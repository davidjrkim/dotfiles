    manage: For isfloating/oldstate check/set, ensure trans client actually exists
    
    In certain instances trans may be set to a window that doesn't actually
    map to a client via wintoclient; in this case it doesn't make sense
    to set isfloating/oldstate since trans is essentially invalid in that
    case / correlates to the above condition check where trans is set /
    XGetTransientForHint is called.

    maybe leak isn't the best word, given that the object lives for the
    entire duration of the program's lifetime.
    
    however, all elements of scheme are free-ed, can't think of any reason
    why scheme itself should be an exception.

    drawbar: Don't expend effort drawing bar if it is occluded
    
    I noticed that a non-trivial amount of dwm's work on my machine was from
    drw_text, which seemed weird, because I have the bar disabled and we
    only use drw_text as part of bar drawing.
    
    Looking more closely, I realised that while we use m->showbar when
    updating the monitor bar margins, but don't skip actually drawing the
    bar if it is hidden. This patch skips drawing it entirely if that is the
    case.
    
    On my machine, this takes 10% of dwm's on-CPU time, primarily from
    restack() and focus().
    
    When the bar is toggled on again, the X server will generate an Expose
    event, and we'll redraw the bar as normal as part of expose().

    Improve speed of drw_text when provided with large strings
    
    Calculates len & ew in drw_font_getexts loop by incrementing instead of
    decrementing; as such avoids proportional increase in time spent in loop
    based on provided strings size.

    Do not allow focus to drift from fullscreen client via focusstack()
    
    It generally doesn't make much sense to allow focusstack() to navigate
    away from the selected fullscreen client, as you can't even see which
    client you're selecting behind it.
    
    I have had this up for a while on the wiki as a separate patch[0], but
    it seems reasonable to avoid this behaviour in dwm mainline, since I'm
    struggling to think of any reason to navigate away from a fullscreen
    client other than a mistake.

    dwm crashes when opening 50+ clients (tile layout)
    
    Many users new to dwm find themselves caught out by being kicked out to the login manager (dwm crashing) when they open 50+ clients for demonstration purposes. The number of clients reported varies depending on the resolution of the monitor.
    
    The cause of this is due to how the default tile layout calculates the height of the next client based on the position of the previous client. Because clients have a minimum size the (ty) position can exceed that of the window height, resulting in (m->wh - ty) becoming negative. The negative height stored as an unsigned int results in a very large height ultimately resulting in dwm crashing.
    
    This patch adds safeguards to prevent the ty and my positions from exceeding that of the window height.

    drawbar: Don't shadow sw global
    
    This jarred me a bit while reading the code, since "sw" usually refers
    to the global screen geometry, but in drawbar() only it refers to
    text-related geometry. Renaming it makes it more obvious that these are
    not related.

    setmfact: Unify bounds for compile-time and runtime mfact
    
    There are two places that mfact can be set:
    
    - In the mfact global, which is defined at compile time and passed
      into m->mfact during monitor setup. No bounds checks are performed,
      but the comment alongside it says that valid values are [0.05..0.95]:
    
          static const float mfact = 0.55; /* factor of master area size [0.05..0.95] */
    
    - By setmfact, which adjusts m->mfact at runtime. It also does some
      minimum and maximum bounds checks, allowing [0.1..0.9]. Values outside
      of that range are ignored, and mfact is not adjusted.
    
    These different thresholds mean that one cannot setmfact 0.95 or 0.05,
    despite the comment above that lists the legal range for mfact.
    
    Clarify this by enforcing the same bounds in setmfact at runtime as
    those listed for mfact at compile time.

    Button passthrough when client is not focused
    
    Before this change it is not possible to press a button in a client on the first
    click if the client is not yet focused. The first click on the button would
    only focus the client and a second click on the button is needed to activate it.
    This situation can occur when moving the mouse over a client (therefore focusing
    it) and then moving the focus to another client with keyboard shortcuts.
    
    After this commit the behavior is fixed and button presses on unfocused clients
    are passed to the client correctly.

    setfullscreen: don't process the property twice
    
    Some clients try to set _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN even when the window is
    already in fullscreen.
    For example, c->oldstate was set two times in a raw and window would
    then always be floating.
    We must check that it's not the case before processing it.

    this variant is known to work, but focus() is ugly - we need in general a better way to handle multihead, this issel-stuff looks awkward (maybe it might be a good idea to set sel to NULL but to introduce a Client *revert which is set if a screen is unfocused, have to think about it further).
